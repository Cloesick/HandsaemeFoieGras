20+

The Product Portfolio
Handsaeme balances high-value luxury items with accessible, everyday delicacies. This chart reveals the vast difference in price-per-kilogram, showcasing a strategy to capture both premium and entry-level markets.

The Ethical Crossroads
The Marketing Claim: "No Gavage"
Retailers emphatically state that force-feeding is NOT applied. This positions the brand as a humane, guilt-free alternative for consumers troubled by conventional methods.

The Owner's Reality
The owner clarifies they use "intensive fattening... with maize in a small space" to achieve the same pathological liver enlargement, replacing one controversial method with another.

The Tipping Point
2023

Foie gras production is BANNED in the Flemish Region of Belgium, regardless of the method used.

This legal action presents an existential threat, invalidating the company's core product and unique selling proposition in its home market.
